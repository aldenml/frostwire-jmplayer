frostwire-jmplayer
==================

The frostwire-jmplayer project (JMPlayer) contains the sources for the <a href="https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-desktop">frostwire</a> media player.

MPlayer-OSX-Extended is the original source that the JMPlayer is based on.  Since much of the original code is not used and is currently removed, having the original source is still useful.

libiconv.2.dylib is a current dependency of the MPlayer and JMPlayer.dylib projects.  it is here temporarily for use until the dependency is removed.  it is to be placed in your /usr/lib/ folder.
